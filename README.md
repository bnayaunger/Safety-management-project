**Safety Management Project**

Group: Bnaya Unger and Oz Nissenboim
Course: Safety Management for Engineers, Ariel University
This project analyzes employee data from a factory to predict the likelihood of workplace accidents. We used Python and applied various machine learning models to identify key factors contributing to accidents and to predict accident probabilities for individual employees.

**Key Features**

Data Analysis: Identified patterns and correlations in employee attributes (e.g., age, experience).
Predictive Modeling: Compared regression models to find the most accurate prediction method.

**Technologies Used**

Python
libraries: Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Numpy
